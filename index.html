        <h2>Welcome to My Personal Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>Feel free to explore the different pages to learn more about me.</p>
        <p1>My name is Nehal Chhetri . Iam currently studing on national school of sciences . 
            <br>
                I enjoy the challenge of writing clean, efficient code and solving complex problems using C. Whether it's creating algorithms, working with pointers, or exploring memory management, I find the low-level aspects of C both fascinating and rewarding. I’ve used C for various personal projects, including building simple applications and learning the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.
<br>
            In the future, I plan to continue exploring C and expand my knowledge to include more advanced topics like multi-threading and network programming. I’m excited to continue improving my skills in C programming and applying them to real-world projects!
